# ForceRefresh KOReader plugin

A plugin to force E-ink refresh on each page turn. If combined with Full refresh rate of `Every page`, will refresh the page twice to really remove the ghosting.

## Installation

1. clone or download this repository.
2. move the whole `forcerefresh.koplugin` folder into the KOReader's plugin folder.
3. open a book, you'll find the setting under `Tools` (wrench icon) > `More tools` > `Force Page Refresh`. You can select the refresh method too, i recommend `Flash UI (balanced)`
4. (Optional) to refresh the page twice on each page turn, open on `Settings` (gear icon) > `Screen` > `E-ink settings` > `Full refresh rate` and choose `Every page`.
